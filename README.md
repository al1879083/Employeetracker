## Technologies Used
- MySQL2: Relational database management system based on SQL â€“ Structured Query Language, used in this applicationt to warehouse and query employee and company data. 
- Node.js - Used for package managment and to execute JavaScript code to build command line tool for server-side scripting.

- Git - Version control system to track changes to source code
- GitHub - Hosts repository that can be deployed to GitHub Pages
 
## Code Snippet
The following code snippet shows the schema that is the base for our link between our index.js file that oeprates the functions for building upon our employee regestry, and data base we create with this same schema setup in our sql workbench. Once these two are connected via calling upon our required mysql package and connection port and host thats configured in our JavaScript. We can then execute the functionality of the application through our JavaScript.

```sql
CREATE DATABASE /*!32312 IF NOT EXISTS*/ employee_db /*!40100 DEFAULT CHARACTER SET utf8mb4 */;
USE employee_db;

DROP TABLE IF EXISTS departments;
CREATE TABLE `departments` (
  `id` int NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  `department_name` varchar(30) DEFAULT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`id`)
) ENGINE=InnoDB AUTO_INCREMENT=19 DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8mb4 COLLATE=utf8mb4_0900_ai_ci;

DROP TABLE IF EXISTS employees;
CREATE TABLE `employees` (
  `id` int NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  `name` varchar(30) NOT NULL,
  `role_id` int DEFAULT NULL,
  `manager_id` int DEFAULT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`id`),
  KEY `role_id` (`role_id`),
  KEY `manager_id` (`manager_id`),
  CONSTRAINT `employees_ibfk_1` FOREIGN KEY (`role_id`) REFERENCES `roles` (`id`),
  CONSTRAINT `employees_ibfk_2` FOREIGN KEY (`manager_id`) REFERENCES `employees` (`id`)
) ENGINE=InnoDB AUTO_INCREMENT=15 DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8mb4 COLLATE=utf8mb4_0900_ai_ci;

DROP TABLE IF EXISTS roles;
CREATE TABLE `roles` (
  `id` int NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  `title` varchar(30) DEFAULT NULL,
  `salary` decimal(8,2) DEFAULT NULL,
  `department_id` int DEFAULT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`id`),
  KEY `department_id` (`department_id`),
  CONSTRAINT `roles_ibfk_1` FOREIGN KEY (`department_id`) REFERENCES `departments` (`id`)
) ENGINE=InnoDB AUTO_INCREMENT=12 DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8mb4 COLLATE=utf8mb4_0900_ai_ci;
